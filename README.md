# Chef-React-App

This is a React app to help people in need of cooked meals for their events find food vendors around them. It is a constant struggle to have a variety of choices when it comes to good food, with this app, we bridge that gap.

## User Features

- A user has access to all vendors registered on the app.
- A user upon sign-in can visit a particular vendor's page, view what is available and then, make a booking for his event upon vendor availability for that date.
- Users can also become vendors upon sign-up after payment of a fee.
- Users who are vendors can create their vendor profile and constantly upload meal-pictures to entice their customers.
